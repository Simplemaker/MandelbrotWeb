Fractal Process Objects use the JSON format. Designed from first principles

By default, each object requires the following
duration - an integer value which sets an upper bound
sampleDimensions - an object {"x":val , "y":val} which contains the samples to take in each dimension
varBounds - 2d array of the form [[x1,x2],[y1,y2]]
finalColor - js filename of final colorization filter


Optional values include
maxDistance - an absolute value limit from the origin
initN - the starting N value for computations
alg - an algorithm filename to be executed
argList - a list of comma separated arguments
filterlist - a list of js files to modify duration values before final colorization

Fractal process objects are meant to describe all information necessary for developing a rendered fractal image.
